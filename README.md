### Introduction/Rationale
We have built a tool to display the tables used by the OS to keep track of open files, assignation of File Descriptors (FD), and processes. We will use files in the ```/proc``` directory for a Linux environment.

The tool takes in the following command line arguments and performs the corresponding tasks:

``` --per-process ```

process FD table
System-wide FD Table
Vnodes FD table, and
a composed view of the previous table
a table summarizing number of FDs open per user processes


### Description of how you solve/approach the problem
Explain in plain English and your OWN words how did you solve the problem.
Use sentences to explain the sequence of steps you took to work in this problem.


### Implementation
   4.i - Describe first in sentences how did you implement your code.
   4.ii - The modules you created and functions within them.
   4.iii - Describe the functions in sentences, e.g. this function does this and that and uses this and that sources, system calls, libraries, etc.
           DO NOT COPY the *documentation* from your code


### Include a pseudo-code of your code __OR__ flow chart or diagram of your program and corresponding functions' calls

### Instructions on how to compile your code
Describe how to compile the code, dependencies with libraries.
For makefiles add details about the rules and what they do and how to use them



### Expected Results
Describe the expected functioning, functionalities and output of your code demonstrating for several cases and uses.



### Test Cases
Explain what cases you run to test your code, what unexpected outcomes you may have, e.g. if using a mistaken CLA.



## Disclaimers
Anything that must be disclaimed about your code.
E.g. my code will fail if the among of memory available on the system is less than 4GB.
